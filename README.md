I assume you meant a `README.md` file for your **MyBiat** application, as "redmin" seems to be a typo. Below is a comprehensive `README.md` file tailored for your digital banking application. It includes an overview, setup instructions, features, and other relevant details for developers and users. You can save this as `README.md` in the root directory of your project.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (with Mongoose)
  - bcryptjs (password hashing)
  - express-session (session management)
- **Frontend**:
  - EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)
  - Bootstrap 5
  - Font Awesome (icons)
- **Development Tools**:
  - Nodemon (auto-restart during development)
  - dotenv (environment variables)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up **MyBiat** locally:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)
- Git

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mybiat.git
   cd mybiat
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up MongoDB**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a MongoDB Atlas connection string.
   - Create a database (e.g., `mybiat`) and update the connection string in the configuration.

## Configuration
1. **Create a `.env` File**:
   In the root directory, create a `.env` file with the following:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mybiat
   SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key
   ```
   - `PORT`: Port for the application.
   - `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Random string for session encryption (use a strong secret in production).

2. **Add Logo**:
   - Place the MyBiat logo in the `public` folder as `logo.png` (or update the path in `views/loading.ejs`).

## Running the Application
1. **Start MongoDB**:
   Ensure your MongoDB instance is running.

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   For development with auto-restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
